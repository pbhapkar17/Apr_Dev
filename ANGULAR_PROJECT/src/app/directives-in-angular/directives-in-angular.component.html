<!-- directives can be classified in 3 categories based on how they behave:

1.Component Directives
2.Structural Directives
3.Attribute Directives

Component Directives: Component directives are used in main class.
They contain the detail of how the component should be processed,
instantiated and used at runtime.

Structural Directives: Structural directives start with a * sign. 
These directives are used to manipulate and change the structure 
of the DOM elements(show or hide).
For example, *ngIf directive, *ngSwitch directive, and *ngFor directive. -->
<!-- uses:
*ngIf Directive: The ngIf allows us to Add/Remove DOM Element.
*ngSwitch Directive: The *ngSwitch allows us to Add/Remove DOM Element. It is similar to switch statement of C#.
*ngFor Directive: The *ngFor directive is used to repeat a portion of HTML template once per each item from an iterable list (Collection). -->

<div>
    <!-- In case of true value of propery compiler will ADD that element to the DOM -->
    <h1 *ngIf = "show1">hhhhhhhhhh</h1>

    <!-- In case of false value of propery compiler will remove that element from DOM -->
    <div *ngIf = "show">I live in mumbai

        <h2>ggg</h2>
        <p>jdjdjdj</p>
    </div>

    <!--In case of undefined value of property it will consider it as a false,
        hence it should
      removed from DOM-->
    <p *ngIf = "toShowPara1">poonam</p>  

    <!-- In case of conditions compiler will show element to DOM
         if condiotion would true else it will remove element from DOM if condition would false -->
    <p *ngIf = "toShowPara === 'poonam'">teststttttt</p>

   <!-- <h1 *ngIf = "undefinedProperty = true">h111111111111111111</h1> not possible-->
   
   <!-- In case of property having NULL value compiler will consider it as a false,hence it should
   removed from DOM-->
   <p *ngIf="nullProperty">kkkkkk</p>
</div>
